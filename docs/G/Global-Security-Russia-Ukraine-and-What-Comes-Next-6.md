## The Global Security Project 
Much of the conflict, from uniforms to drones, came from “grassroots” efforts amongst the population. The ubiquity of technology and social media makes it possible for individuals, both inside and outside of the country to contribute to collective security.  The democratization of security at the individual level can be a powerful tool if aggregated in a thoughtful and meaningful way. While the Ukrainian government focuses on many of the lateral and vertical means of organizing security, Ukrainians and democratically-minded people throughout the world can organize to educate, fundraise, and organize in unique and useful ways. Ideally, these approaches would meet in the middle toward a common direction. 

As a reserve infantry officer, politician, diplomat, and security expert, I am looking to take the lead in just such a scenario. I participate in the "Ukraine-NATO" Program, founded #USAStandsWithUkraine and #GlobalSecurity Project together with Mike Robinson (Former US Army Special Forces counterterrorism officer, Nuclear Field Artillery, and USA Hispanic Businessman of the Year). #USAStandsWithUkraine is an American-Ukrainian group supporting Ukraine and the Global Security Project is part of our initiatives. The Global Security Project aims to unite professionals for sharing experiences, supporting Ukraine, and strengthening our defensive capacity. I believe our topical project could strengthen Ukraine on national and international levels, including the Global Security Forum we would like to perform in the USA.

n the spring of 2022, I and the team conducted an interview for the Ukrainian media "Ukrinform" with retired U.S. Army Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel and founder of AFGfree.org Perry Blackburn. Together we discussed supporting Ukraine, military experience of the United States of America that could be used by Ukrainians, as well as effective tactics, techniques, and procedures for defending Ukraine. 

Our teams are also creating #Cadet2Cadet and #Warrior2Warrior Hostomel Case Study concerning the Ukrainian defense of the Hostomel Airport in Kyiv Oblast, for use in the self-development of cadets, emerging leaders, and young academics. The honorary “VIP mentors” of the project are retired U.S. Army General and former CIA Director, David H. Petraeus and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark P. Hertling.  Together with Mike Robinson, I interviewed General (R) Petraeus and LTG (R) Hertling about the Ukrainian defense of Hostomel Airport and the mistakes of Russian forces.  Alongside the Hostomel Case Study, we have integrated the "Ukraine Crucifixion '' War Exhibition Project making a tour of the artifacts from the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War to the United States. Through these organizations, I became acquainted with Lieutenant Colonel (P) Nathan M. Colvin who is a Ph.D.  student at Old Dominion University. Through this relationship, I am presenting this very paper and sitting on a panel on Ukrainian affairs at the 26th Annual Old Dominion Graduate Research Conference. This represents another step towards realizing the goals of a formalized Global Security Project and our forum, which leverages the “bottom-up” approach to security.
