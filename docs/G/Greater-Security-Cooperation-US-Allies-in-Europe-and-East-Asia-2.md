## Similarities
US Allies in Europe and East Asia are part of an extended deterrence success story. Although adversaries have conducted large-scale military attacks against countries with close security ties to the United States— South Korea in 1950, Taiwan in 1954, and Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani Wars—there appears to be no such attack against a US Ally protected by an *applicable* defense obligation of the United States.<sup>15</sup>

The two regions also present important similarities in terms of their threat environments. One common feature relates to the threat posed by theater-range missiles and the proliferation of anti-access/ area-denial capabilities. This concern becomes particularly pressing following the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty: progress in fielding theater-range missiles and anti-access/ area-denial capabilities is enabling Russia and China to behave more aggressively. In this context, US Allies in Europe and East Asia face a similar conceptual problem—how to counter an impending missile challenge through enhanced missile defense capabilities, which includes

weighing the pros and cons of deploying theater-range missiles to deter Russian and Chinese aggression.<sup>16</sup>

And even if they may not go so far as launching a direct attack on US Allies, Russia’s or China’s missile and military buildup could give them the confidence to engage more aggressively in hybrid or gray-zone forms of warfare.<sup>17</sup> Precisely because US extended deterrence has been so successful in preventing armed conflicts, China and Russia now engage in hybrid or gray-zone tactics, which are aggressive but aimed to avoid triggering military retaliation. Russia’s “Little Green Men” have infiltrated Ukraine since 2014, while China’s “Little Blue Men” have advanced Chinese interests in the South and East China Seas.<sup>18</sup> As US Alliances were originally designed with large-scale armed aggression in mind, such hybrid or gray-zone tactics leave uncertainty about how these Alliances can cope with them.<sup>19</sup> The link between traditional military threats and nontraditional ones is therefore concerning for US Allies in both regions.

The challenges China and Russia pose to US Allies in East Asia and Europe is further compounded by growing Sino-Russian cooperation. Such cooperation has grown steadily in the post–Cold War era, and the two former adversaries now appear to be aligned strategically.<sup>20</sup> In particular, periodic joint exercises, staff exchanges, and arms sales point to an increasingly institutionalized military cooperation. Russian arms sales and technology have played an important part in the development of Chinese anti-access/area-denial capabilities. More broadly, Russia and China appear to be learning from each other’s best practices in hybrid forms of warfare.<sup>21</sup>

As a function of this strategic military cooperation, simultaneous probing by China and Russia of US Allies and interests in East Asia and Europe could help disperse US resources and thus maximize the chances of success for Beijing and Moscow. More broadly, Sino-Russian diplomatic and economic cooperation may also create an effective wedge against US Alliances. By working together, China and Russia could reduce the negative repercussions of their actions in the East and South China Seas or Ukraine, respectively, and also sabotage western efforts outside East Asia and Europe, as the situation in Syria shows.

the extent the credibility of US military protection is interconnected in different parts of the world, China and Russia could also work together to erode Allies’ confidence in US extended deterrence.

Finally, a worsening regional threat environment brings back fears of abandonment among US Allies in both Europe and East Asia.<sup>22</sup> Such fears are perhaps further compounded both by the aforementioned America First doctrine and by the fact that the need to deal with greatpower challengers on multiple fronts may force the United States to prioritize the other region. Indeed, Trump openly questioned the value of US Alliances and demanded all Allies increase their financial payments to the United States.<sup>23</sup> In the late 2019 negotiations with South Korea on defense cost-sharing, for example, the United States reportedly demanded a fivefold increase, although this demand was subsequently dropped.<sup>24</sup>

Trump also questioned the US commitment to NATO’s collective defense and demanded NATO Allies increase defense spending.<sup>25</sup> US pressure on its Allies for economic concessions or increased defense spending was by no means a new phenomenon, but these recent demands were more serious because they were combined with a contempt for the value of US Alliances. Even as the Biden-Harris administration seeks to rebuild failing Alliances, Allies can no longer take such commitments for granted.
