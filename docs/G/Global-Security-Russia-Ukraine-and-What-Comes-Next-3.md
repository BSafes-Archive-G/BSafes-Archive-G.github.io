## The World Outside of NATO 
In parallel with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the situation between North Korea and South Korea grows increasingly tense<sup>16</sup> . In October 2022, the DPRK launched ballistic missiles, as well as conducted other tests, including simulating the use of nuclear weapons against South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stressed that South Korea is the enemy and that he will not talk about any issue with him. He also said that the tactical nuclear forces of his country have demonstrated a high probability to act accordingly in a difficult geopolitical situation. In addition, the head of North Korea accused South Korea of growing instability in the region and the readiness of North Korea to take appropriate military measures.

Like Ukrainians, South Koreans also woke up last year to the roar of sirens when North Koreans violated their airspace, including with drones.<sup>17</sup> In addition, official Pyongyang has repeatedly made statements about supporting Russian policy in general and aggression against Ukraine – in particular, mirroring the Kremlin's narrative.<sup>18</sup> After all, based on official statements from the Russian Federation, our Euro-Atlantic European integration choice "provoked" the Russian Federation to retaliate "in the name of its security." In turn, the leadership of South Korea made it clear that a false, unjust peace in Ukraine would not only do nothing to end the war but would also shake the foundations of global security (already shaken by Russian aggression). As in our case, South Korea is not ready to remain silent in response to the aggression of a neighboring state just because the neighboring state is unclear. Moreover, official Seoul has declared its readiness to give a tough response to any aggression.

It is noteworthy that the actions of North Korea concerning the South resemble the actions of the Russian Federation toward Ukraine. Provocations, false propaganda, "saber-rattling".That is why the democratic world needs to support Ukraine in order not only to survive but also to win. And in parallel with this, we all need to unite to create a new model of global security, since we are talking not only about Ukraine but about the entire modern system of international security.
