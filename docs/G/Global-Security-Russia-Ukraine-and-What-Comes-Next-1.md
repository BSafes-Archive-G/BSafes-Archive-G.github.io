## Building Security During War
Ukraine is faced with the difficult task of creating a new security reality while trying to win a terrible war. There are currently signs of new and positive trends – both on the local battlefield and international frontlines. In addition to demonstrating success at the front, Ukraine is actively working on security guarantees and receiving military assistance from allies (Figure 1). It is important to note that, for example, the United States of America is supplying Ukraine with more than military assistance packages. The US Treasury Department imposed new sanctions against individuals associated with the Iranian drone manufacturer, which were used by Russia against Ukraine.  Those sanctions were also imposed on the director of the organization, which is responsible for overseeing Iran's ballistic missile programs. The United States and many other allies are applying multiple elements of national power - diplomatic, informational, military, and economic. <sup>4</sup>

Additionally, statements such as those made in January of this year at Davos by Henry Kissinger, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, and many others regarding the support of Ukraine for joining NATO indicate a growing awareness of the threats to global security. Kissinger, after all, formally opposed Ukrainian entry into NATO, but now says “the idea of a neutral Ukraine under these conditions is no longer meaningful”.<sup>5</sup> Russia’s actions are increasing the support to soundly defeat the invader, which continues its aggression against Ukraine, as well as all democratic foundations. The blatant attacks from the Russian Federation are becoming more cynical, openly barbaric, and confirming the grounds for the world-famous #RussiaIsATerroristState. Even the usually mild European Union declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. <sup>6</sup>
