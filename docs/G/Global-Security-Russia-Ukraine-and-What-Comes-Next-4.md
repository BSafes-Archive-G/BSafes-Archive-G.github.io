## Sī vīs pācem, parā bellum 
At the moment, the entire civilized world is facing a challenge regarding the creation of such a mechanism for security and the prevention of wars, which will be impossible to disable, especially motivating its aggression with propaganda clichés, historical phantom pains, imperial ambitions, or without motivating anything at all. The so-called "neutral" position of individual states during the current full-scale war in Ukraine will be forever engraved in the history of these states. The "neutral" position today means only one thing: support for aggression, support for the destruction of civilians, and support for the encroachments of a terrorist state on the global security of the entire civilized world.

Thus, a "neutral" position is always a choice, a choice to support a state that brings death and devastation, and a choice to be on the opposite side of global security.  For example, Ukrainian deminers are now undergoing training in Cambodia, but at the same time, the Prime Minister of Cambodia said that the country is ready to teach demining to any other country if the country asks for it. “Cambodia did not provide any military support to Ukraine. Cambodia does not have such an opportunity. Cambodia's technical assistance to Ukrainian sappers is a purely humanitarian act," said Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.<sup>19</sup>

Likewise, every country in the world is challenged with a decision whether to contribute to the new model of world security or not. The so-called "neutral" position of individual states during the current full-scale war in Ukraine will be forever engraved in the history of these states. The "neutral" position today means only one thing: support for aggression, support for the destruction of civilians, and support for the encroachments of a terrorist state on the global security of the entire civilized world. 

Sī vīs pācem, parā bellum, or "If you want peace, prepare for war," wrote Publius Vegetius Renatus. Similarly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called for military support for Ukraine as it is the best way to achieve a peaceful negotiated solution to the war. "We see that the Russians are preparing for a new offensive, that they are mobilizing more soldiers, more than 200,000 people, and maybe even more.  That they are actively building up weapons and ammunition," Stoltenberg said. "And most importantly, we see no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion, which is to control the neighbor, to control Ukraine. So, if this is the case, we must be prepared for a long journey," Stoltenberg said.<sup>20</sup> Thus, military assistance to Ukraine from many international partners remains one of the main components of the support of both the state of Ukraine and the possibility of creating a new model of Global Security.

While the Russian Federation justifies its crimes on the territory of Ukraine with false calls for peace and the alleged liberation of our country from the Nazis, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, offered the world community the Formula for Peace. "To liberate all our land from the Rashists, we will have to fight for some time ...  Fight! But if the victory will still be ours, and we are sure of it, is it not worth trying to implement our formula for peace to save thousands of lives and save the world from new destabilizations? That's why I want to present our vision of the path to peace – how it can be achieved. And not only for us but also for all of you, your allies, and partners," Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. "We should not offer Ukraine compromises with conscience, sovereignty, territory, and independence. We respect the rules, and we are people of our word. Ukraine has always been the leader of peacekeeping efforts – and the world has seen it. And if Russia says it wants to end this war, let it prove it with action.” <sup>21</sup>

Unfortunately, a strong defense and fighting until the war is complete are the only antidotes to aggression, neutrality, and appeasement. Zelensky goes on to say “Russia's words cannot be trusted, and there will be no "Minsk-3" that Russia will violate immediately after signing. If there is no response to restore peace, it means that Russia simply wants to deceive all of you, deceive the world, and freeze the war just when its defeats have become especially noticeable. Ukraine will not allow Russia to wait it out, build up its forces, and then start a new series of terror and global destabilization. I am sure that now it is necessary and possible to stop the destructive Russian war."
