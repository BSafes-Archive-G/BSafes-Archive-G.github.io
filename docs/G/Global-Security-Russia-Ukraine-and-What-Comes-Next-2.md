## The Future of NATO is Ukraine 
The aggressor state demonstrates to the whole world that it does not plan to stop. This creates challenges throughout Europe, the arctic, the Middle East, Africa, and around the world. Russia continues to mobilize, regroup troops and transform within the framework of the leadership of the so-called "special operation".<sup>7</sup> Massive rocket attacks on Ukrainian settlements led, among other things, to the tragedy in the Dnieper (in January of this year), once again confirming that the Russian Federation will not stop unilaterally.<sup>8</sup> Therefore, we are witnessing not only relevant statements from our Western partners but also real support that strengthens Ukraine and weakens Russia – in the name of global security. Ukraine, which increases its likelihood for membership in NATO in the foreseeable future, has every chance to unite the whole world for the sake of a new model of global security, becoming its flagship.<sup>9</sup>

One of the main conclusions that Ukraine demonstrated during a full-scale war is the realization that our army is modern, professional, and successfully implementing NATO standards.<sup>10</sup> Ukrainian forces continuously master both new weapons and new thinking, unlike the Russian army, which is supposedly considered the second-best army in the world.<sup>11</sup> The Russian army is not just losing, but also demonstrating the lack of at least elementary preparation for a new type of war in the modern world.<sup>12</sup> Monitoring of the information environment indicates that the Russian army is not only inadequately equipped but also that its soldiers and leaders are lacking intrinsic motivation regarding the desire to fight in Ukraine.<sup>13</sup>

In turn, thanks to Ukrainian professionalism, as well as a modern and fundamental approach to the implementation of reforms, Ukraine shows high results not only on the battlefield but also in the foreign policy sector. It is important to note that the President of Ukraine and representatives of the Office of the President are actively voicing the concept of a new global security system. President Zelensky and his cabinet have already announced that a summit dedicated to the Peace Formula proposed should take place soon. <sup>14</sup>

Ukrainians are convinced that more and more countries will support Ukraine's vision of a truly functioning global security system, which implies both security guarantees for Ukraine now and the cessation of wars once and for all. These security guarantees are important not only for Ukraine but for the entire civilized world. Ukraine is becoming the cornerstone of the new security order, within the framework of which in the foreseeable future any attempts to show aggression would be prevented. That is why many experts predict that Ukraine will defeat the enemy not only on the battlefield but also on the international front. Foreign policy and diplomatic processes in the context of a full-scale war are integral parts of the processes on the way to peace and the creation of a new mechanism for global security. At the same time, the liberation of territories and the strengthening of defense capability is the main goal of Ukraine. But given that for the "question of peace," Ukraine needs security guarantees and support from across the world.

It is important to accept that now every NATO member country is faced with a choice regarding the adoption of political decisions from the perspective of the RussianUkrainian war. A war that is inherently much larger than the war on the territory of Ukraine because of the attack of the Russian Federation. Thus, Russia's aggression challenged the foundations of global security. The Russian federation's attack on Ukraine is not only about Ukraine, but also about Europe, and the world. Environmental and economic problems, numerous crises (including food), the fall of a rocket in Poland, and energy shortages in Moldova - these are all echoes of the war unleashed by Russia. Russia is also trying to "ring" nations with nuclear weapons. This increases threats to global order, not just local security. In other words, the Russian Federation involved the entire civilized world, including NATO states, in the war. That is simply a factor that the world should not agree upon within a global security framework.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg regularly emphasizes in his statements the need to make a choice: to defend democratic values, aiding Ukraine and thereby taking care of his future, or not taking any action - which equates to direct or indirect support of the aggressor.<sup>15</sup> A neutral position at the moment is very alarming.  For its part, Ukraine believes that NATO allies will make the right choice regarding the decisions taken, increasing support for Ukraine, and participating in the creation of a new effective security system for the whole world.
