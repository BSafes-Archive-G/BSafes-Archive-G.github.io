## The Stage
On July 23, 2019, Russia and China jointly flew warplanes near island clusters called Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan respectively, driving a wedge between two US Allies that dispute the

sovereignty over these islands.<sup>2</sup> And security coordination between Moscow and Beijing is not limited to East Asia: in July 2017, China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy and the Russian Navy participated in a joint exercise in the Baltic Sea.<sup>3</sup> According to a Chinese military expert, China and Russia “need to lean on each other for support to deal with hostilities from different fronts.”<sup>4</sup> In January 2019, then US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told Congress, “China and Russia are more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s, and the relationship is likely to strengthen in the coming year as some of their interests and threat perceptions converge.”<sup>5</sup>

Moreover, the Biden-Harris administration’s references to a global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism implicitly assume an alignment between Russia and China and thus lower expectations Washington will try to create fissures between the two nations.<sup>6</sup> Indeed, the Biden White House’s Interim National Security Strategic Guidance alludes to the fact that Russia and China represent a threat to US Allies and interests in the critical regions of Europe and the Indo-Pacific.<sup>7</sup> The prospect of deeper security coordination between those two powers in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and elsewhere threatens to complicate America’s global strategic picture.

In contrast, US Allies in Europe and Asia continue to display rather tenuous security ties, despite repeated promises of further cooperation. For decades, these distant groupings of US Allies have enjoyed a quasi-alliance with each other, a term used by some scholars to designate the relationship between those states who share alliance ties with a common third party but not with each other.<sup>8</sup> Despite such long-standing quasi-alliance ties, US Allies in Europe and East Asia have had a limited security interaction with each other due to resource scarcity, geographical distance, and the need to prioritize threats in their respective regions.<sup>9</sup> Yet US European and East Asian Allies now

have good reasons to develop more robust security relationships with each other. At least three sets of interrelated developments underscore this point.

The first development, already mentioned, relates to improving security cooperation between China and Russia.<sup>10</sup> Greater coordination in security policies can allow these two powers to maintain a cohesive front, outflank the United States, and undermine the security of America’s European and East Asian Allies. Notably, through arms transfers and greater military coordination, Russia and China have strengthened each other’s capabilities, while mutually learning from best technological and operational practices.

Moreover, Russia and China appear to be engaging in coordinated probing in Europe and East Asia, executing incremental, self-restrained actions designed to test the reactions of the United States and its Allies and better gauge the boundaries of their freedom of action while staying below the threshold of traditional military activity.<sup>11</sup> Coordinated Sino-Russian actions against US interests and Allies in Europe and East Asia could force Washington into a long and resource-draining two-flank competition and compel it to make difficult choices. Such coordinated activities could lead to tensions between the United States and its Allies regarding which threats to prioritize, but could also lead to tensions between US Allies in the two regions as they compete for US resources and attention.

The second development pertains to the similarity of the regional threats US Allies in Europe and East Asia face. Through their advances in precision strike and missile modernization programs, Russia and China seek to undermine the local military balance in northeastern Europe and in the Western Pacific. Relatedly, as they strengthen their local military positions relative to that of the United States and foster the perception they may enjoy local military superiority in certain parts of Europe or the Western Pacific, Moscow and Beijing can more confidently engage in nontraditional forms of probing. Conceptually, US Allies in Europe and East Asia face a similar problem, namely, how to counter the threat posed by Russian and Chinese military modernization and hybrid or gray-zone activities. To address such similar threats, US Allies must draw on similar operational concepts, capabilities, and technologies, which will reveal opportunities for collaboration.

The third development concerns persistent uncertainty about US security commitments to either region. This problem became particularly pressing in the face of US President Donald Trump’s “America First” vision and mixed signals about the value of Alliances.<sup>12</sup> Even under the Biden-Harris administration, recovering the damaged trust in

US Alliances will require the efforts of all parties to those Alliances. Although the Biden-Harris administration has put Alliances at the center of its foreign policy, US Allies cannot rule out the possibility of a less Alliance-friendly president in the future.

Concerns about US security commitments also include questions about how the United States will prioritize between Europe and East Asia at a time when America faces two great-power challengers simultaneously, and when the power gap it enjoyed during the socalled unipolar era appears to be diminishing.<sup>13</sup> The specter of US retrenchment from their regions incentivizes Allies to hedge, either by investing in strengthening their own autonomy or diversifying their portfolio of security partnerships.<sup>14</sup> Greater ties with each other can be part of that package. To be sure, such ties cannot be seen as an adequate alternative to their existing Alliances with the United States, because no group of countries can match US power-projection capabilities. Rather, these ties can strengthen the bargaining position of Allies in both regions vis-à-vis the United States and can hedge against uncertainty surrounding the future of US foreign policy.
