## Winning the War, Securing the Peace 
To close the gate on Russia, while opening the door for a better peace, it is necessary to first adequately close out the current Russian aggressions. The ten points of the Peace Formula proposed by Vladimir Zelensky are as follows:
1. Radiation and nuclear safety
2. Food security
3. Energy security
4. Release of all prisoners and deportees
5. Implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of territorial integrity and world order
6. Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities
7. Return of justice
8. Counteracting ecocide
9. Prevention of escalation
10.Fixing the end of the war<sup>22</sup>

Therefore, to call for peace, uniting the whole world, and hiding behind slogans about peace, while committing murders at the same time after an attack on a supposedly "brotherly" country is a choice. The choice to go down in history as a murderer who forever perpetuated in chronicles the hatred of his country... or a President who united the entire civilized world for the sake of peace in his country and the sake of a new model of global security.

"Every war ends diplomatically. Each war ends as a result of actions on the battlefield and at the negotiating table," said Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba. And besides the fact that the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky proposed the "Formula of Peace", which consists of ten points, Ukraine announced the holding of the Global Peace Formula Summit until the end of February 2023. At the same time, UN Secretary-General António Guterres is considered a mediator. "He has established himself as an effective mediator and an effective negotiator, and most importantly - as a person of principle and honesty," Dmytro Kuleba explained.

"The United Nations could be the best place to hold this summit because it's not about doing a favor to a particular country. We are talking about involving everyone in the initiative," the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine added.<sup>23</sup> Thus, Ukraine is not only the initiator of the creation of a platform for discussing the global formula for peace, but also the flagship of a new model of global security, which is based on peace and the creation of appropriate conditions for it. Last year, the Office of the President of Ukraine established the International Working Group on Security Assurances for Ukraine, cochaired by the Head of the Office of President Andriy Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Last autumn, the above-mentioned working group presented to the head of state Volodymyr Zelensky the recommendations developed by the group on future security guarantees for Ukraine, which should become the basis of the document called the Kyiv Security Compact.

This document should become the basis for future agreements between Ukraine and the guarantor countries of our security. "The idea of the Kyiv Security Treaty developed jointly with former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, can provide a solution. It should be a joint document on strategic partnership, which unites Ukraine and the guarantor countries. The principle is simple: Ukraine's security depends primarily on its ability to defend itself. To do this effectively, Ukraine needs long-term contributions from its allies.

Although the United Nations might be recommended by Ukrainian leadership, for long-term security, there are issues with this forum. Member nations in the UN, like Russia, demonstrate they do not adhere to the UN Charter or the role demanded of them in the security council. Security guarantees – not assurances but guarantees – must come from a core group of Ukraine's allies with significant military capabilities, who share similar values. They must be prepared to make both political and legal
commitments. Along with military assistance commitments, a wider group of international partners should support a set of sanctions-based non-military safeguards.  We must ensure that the price of aggression is too high for Russia. Helping Ukraine protect, survive and win is an investment in a safer future for the world," said Andriy Yermak, Head of the President's Office, at the Halifax International Security Forum in November 2022. Dubbed the "Kyiv Security Treaty," the plan aims to provide legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine from a coalition of Western countries to enhance its ability to repel Russian attacks by conducting large-scale joint exercises, providing advanced defense weapons systems, and supporting the development of the country's defense-industrial base.<sup>24</sup>

Further, Ukraine has already put in an application for accelerated acceptance to the North Atlantic Alliance, and the President of Ukraine, in turn, called on Western partners to implement the proposals of security guarantees prepared by Ukraine, outlined in the Kyiv Security Compact. However, freedom is challenged across the world by countries like North Korea, Iran, and Syria. Africa may yet become a zone of additional threats seeded by countries like Russia. Therefore a pathway toward a global democratic security order is needed.
