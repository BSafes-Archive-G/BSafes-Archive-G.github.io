## Introduction
February 24, 2022, changed the lives of all Ukrainians. People throughout the country woke up to the sounds of bombings in the cities, and all soon knew that the fullscale war had begun.  <sup>1</sup> That morning Ukrainians realized that Russians could never become “brothers and sisters” again. Russia is a terrorist state that is continuing to commit war crimes.<sup>2</sup> Crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity. Russia has now challenged the entire world with bombings, murder, and acts against civilians - including women and children.  <sup>3</sup> However, these unthinkable circumstances now allow Ukraine to change the situation together with the rest of the liberal world by creating a new model of defense and security. 

Ukraine and the liberal democracies can only withstand emerging threats by implementing a global security system with the capability to stop the transnational terrorism of the Russian Federation. Where the United Nations includes all states, regardless of their beliefs, this security order would include those with similar values to secure freedom and democracy. In other words, where NATO focuses on Europe, this new order would join the free world regardless of geographic location. As a start towards this future, I propose a global security program that highlights the risks of autocratic states like Russia, both near and far.
