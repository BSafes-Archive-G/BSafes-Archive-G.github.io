## Conclusion 
For many years, Russia’s malign influence and gray zone activities hid the scope of its strategic planning. However, with the 2014 and 2022 invasions, Russia lays bare their true intentions. The threat of its autocratic aims reaches far outside of Ukraine in Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Syria, and multiple African countries. Russia supports authoritarian regimes in Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, and beyond. The threat of Russia must be stopped today, but it is also likely to endure for some time. However, with parallel work of government and people, we can build better security institutions, such as ones designed specifically around freedom and democracy. Whether at the individual or national level, this sort of cooperation is the best way forward for Ukraine, the west, and other democratic nations.
