ABSTRACT: Growing Sino-Russian coordination necessitates greater security cooperation between US Allies in Europe and East Asia. US Allies in both regions face remarkably similar threats requiring similar operational concepts, capabilities, and technologies. Further, these Allies must hedge against the specter of US abandonment. An exploration of the links between the two geographically distant US Alliance networks illustrates the Allies’ perspectives on US extended deterrence and highlights opportunities to devise better policies for cooperation.

Over the last decade, strategic links between East Asia and Europe have grown rapidly. Consequently, the analysis and management of US Alliances require an interregional perspective that explicitly assesses the connections between the security and geopolitical dynamics in both regions. As they have in the past, US Alliances must play a central role in today’s era of renewed greatpower competition.<sup>1</sup> After all, one of the advantages the United States enjoys vis-à-vis either China or Russia is its possession of a strongly institutionalized alliance system. If the United States and its Allies remain complacent, however, China and Russia could coordinate to divide US attention and resources and drive wedges within and between existing US Alliances.

Leveraging synergies between US Alliances in both regions would benefit the United States in the context of its competition with Russia and China. But this is not a debate confined to Washington. America’s European and East Asian Allies must proactively engage in interregional dialogues to remain cohesive in the face of greater Sino-Russian coordination and to counter skepticism in the United States about the value of Alliances.
