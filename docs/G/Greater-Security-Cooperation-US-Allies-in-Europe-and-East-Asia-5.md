## Conclusion
America’s European and East Asian Allies are far away from each other, but their links with the United States generate important geopolitical crossovers between regions. These nexuses become increasingly apparent as the threat by Russia and China to US regional Allies intensifies simultaneously. Against that backdrop, a number of relevant questions emerge. How can European and East Asian Allies strengthen deterrence in their respective regions? And what can they learn from each other’s experiences in that regard? What are the

similarities, differences, and possible connections between US Alliances in Europe and East Asia? What are the perceptions of credibility of US extended deterrence that abound in Europe and northeast Asia?

This article has addressed these questions by identifying some of the similarities, differences, and possible synergies between US Alliances in Europe and East Asia. While interregional dialogues thus far have focused on transnational challenges, a focus on deterrence against great-power challengers is warranted. Certainly as their respective regional security environments worsen, European and East Asian Allies are becoming increasingly focused on their immediate vicinities. This perspective limits the scope for direct engagement beyond each country’s region. Yet all countries face similar challenges, ranging from missile proliferation and hybrid forms of warfare from Russia, China, or (to a lesser extent) North Korea to mounting concerns about America’s commitment to their security.

Greater coordination can help US Allies learn from each other’s experiences and best practices in dealing with regional challengers and better managing their relations with the United States, particularly in the face of increasing strategic coordination between China and Russia. Additionally, diplomatic support and greater economic engagement can be mutually beneficial in terms of strengthening resilience against regional challengers, mitigating excessive dependence on the United States, and hedging against the possibility of US retrenchment in the future. In particular, since China’s geo-economic challenge is global in scope US Allies worldwide can benefit from supporting each other against Chinese predatory behavior. Thus, security dialogues between European and East Asian Allies should involve top leaders who can link the global, interregional, economic, and security aspects of cooperation.
