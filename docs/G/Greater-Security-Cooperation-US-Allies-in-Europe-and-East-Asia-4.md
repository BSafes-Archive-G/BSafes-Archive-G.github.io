meaningful impact on the strategic calculations of US Allies in each region—and even on the United States itself. When new developments create uncertainty about US policy, with potential implications for the United States’ reputation as an Ally or the allocation of US military resources, the Allies pay close attention to situations in distant regions.

Moreover, as the United States prepares for global competition with China, Washington has been paving the road for interregional cooperation between US Allies. For example, a recent expert group report to the NATO secretary general argues China is “best understood as a full-spectrum systemic rival, rather than a purely economic player or an only Asia-focused security actor,” and asserts “NATO must devote much more time, political resources and action to the security challenges posed by China.”<sup>31</sup>

Two somewhat contradictory interregional connections are particularly important for US Alliances. First, US Allies in both regions are affected by the reputation of the United States as a military protector.<sup>32</sup> Insofar as reputation is a global commodity, all US Allies have reasons to support the reputation of the United States—the credibility of US extended deterrence helps guarantee their own security. Yet US military resources, including policymakers’ attention, are limited, resulting in an inevitable trade-off between what the United States can commit to in East Asia and in Europe.

Thus, just as the Obama administration’s rebalance to Asia or the Trump administration’s emphasis on competition with China provoked uneasiness among European Allies about the sustainability of Washington’s commitment to Europe, America’s reengagement with Europe after Russia’s annexation of Crimea led to questions in Asia about the future of the alleged rebalance. In this regard, the complementary and competitive relations between the two regions are an important background to any interregional collaboration among the Allies.

Beyond these important but abstract connections, what can the United States and its Allies gain from greater interregional cooperation? Arguably the most important contributions America’s European and East Asian Allies can provide to each other’s security are indirect. In a context defined by resource scarcity and a worsening threat environment in Europe and East Asia, the United States would prefer its Allies concentrate their defense resources and efforts in their respective regions. In this vein, US experts and policymakers often argue the most efficient way to use the resources and capabilities of America’s European Allies is to deter Russia and provide security in their own continent—and

its immediate neighborhood—thus relieving Washington of its burden there as it prioritizes Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.<sup>33</sup> The same logic applies in relation to America’s East Asian Allies, whom the United States would rather have focus on deterring China in the Western Pacific.<sup>34</sup>

America’s European Allies would also derive important indirect benefits if East Asian Allies were to step up their defense and security efforts, and vice versa. From a European perspective, perhaps the most useful contribution East Asian Allies can make is to increase their own military capabilities while also reducing tensions with China. Likewise, East Asian Allies would very much appreciate a greater European defense effort, which could free up US resources badly needed in East Asia.<sup>35</sup> East Asian Allies would also welcome a de-escalation between the West and Russia—perceived to be a relevant stakeholder in Asian security.<sup>36</sup> From their viewpoint, the more conflictual the relationship between the United States and Russia is, the more of a spoiler attitude Moscow may adopt in East Asia, for example, by closing ranks with China on North Korea and other issues.

Even though America’s European and East Asian Allies focus their efforts on their respective regions, the fact they face similar militarystrategic problems offers opportunities for a structured security dialogue. Missile defense is one such area. Both sets of allies face the problem of proliferation of theater-range missiles and the challenges of addressing this threat through a combination of US support, the development of indigenous missile defense capabilities, and the development and deployment of theater-range missiles.<sup>37</sup> Another opportunity relates to countering hybrid warfare and related problems such as cybersecurity or disinformation.<sup>38</sup>

Through a more structured dialogue, America’s European and East Asian Allies could learn best practices from each other in missile defense or hybrid threat countermeasures—including questions relating to divisions of labor with the United States—and even cooperate in research and technology. In this vein, the NATO 2030: United for a New Era report argues the Alliance should “deepen cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners, including by strengthening information-sharing and creating regularised dialogues on technological cooperation and pooling of R&D in select fields.”<sup>39</sup>

To be sure, America’s European and East Asian Allies can directly contribute to each other’s security in a number of ways. Through the

European Union’s arms embargo against China, the steady flow of highquality European weapons systems to East Asia, and engagement in defense cooperation with key US Allies and partners in the region such as Japan, Australia, and Vietnam, European Allies are contributing to the security of East Asian Allies, and the advancement of US strategic objectives in that region.<sup>40</sup>

Another important direct contribution to security relates to diplomatic support in the face of political disputes. Having support from Allies beyond the scope of any given region adds legitimacy to US foreign policy, reinforcing its aspiration to frame the US position as grounded in global rules and norms. In this regard, the support from Japan and other East Asian Allies in denouncing Russia’s annexation of Crimea or that of European Allies in denouncing Chinese actions in the South China Sea represents an important legitimacy boost.<sup>41</sup> Arguably, the most practical assistance East Asian Allies can expect from European Allies is diplomatic and political support. For instance, European diplomatic support is important for Japan on issues such as North Korea’s nuclear weapons development and territorial disputes with China.<sup>42</sup> Diplomatic and political support from European Allies makes it easier for East Asian Allies to frame certain problems (for example, territorial disputes with China or North Korea’s nuclear program) as threats to the rules-based international order, rather than merely a by-product of power politics.

Last but not least, since China is expanding its influence, mostly through geo-economic tools and the creation of an economic hierarchy in Asia, it is also important for East Asian Allies to receive European assistance in countering China’s economic influence attempts. Until recently, China’s power-projection capabilities were limited, and Beijing’s leverage over other states derived mostly from its economic clout rather than its ability to either threaten or protect other states. As the debate over membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or the debate over Huawei’s role in 5G networks illustrates, China can resort to divide-and-rule tactics vis-à-vis US Allies in both regions.
