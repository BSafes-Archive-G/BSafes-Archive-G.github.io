## Differences
Beyond the well-known distinction between the multilateral NATO and bilateral Alliances in East Asia, there are important differences in how US Allies relate to regional threats. First, US European Allies are relatively economically self-reliant. Even though there is some degree of dependence on Russia, such dependence is confined to the hydrocarbon sector, which appears to be decreasing and is mutual—Russia is badly in need of European markets, investments, and technology.<sup>26</sup> Thus the degree of economic interaction and interdependence European Allies have with the United States far outweighs their dealings with Russia. In contrast, the economies of America’s East Asian Allies are deeply intertwined with China, which has become the economic center of

gravity in the region.<sup>27</sup> The interests of the East Asian Allies to preserve good economic relations with China may at times undermine the cohesion of America’s Alliances in East Asia.

Another interregional difference lies in the geographic characteristics of the two theaters. Whereas US Allies in East Asia face China’s military challenges at sea over maritime territorial disputes, European Allies confront primarily land-based military threats from Russia.<sup>29</sup> In the military component of its rebalance to Asia, therefore, the Obama administration emphasized increased investment in the Navy.<sup>29</sup>

Aside from different military requirements, the geographical differences are likely to produce different political challenges for the Alliances. Because maritime borders and territories tend to be far from metropolitan areas and have few residents, disputants may have a more difficult time justifying military conflict for their claims or, alternatively, believe escalation is easier to control than it is on land. For the United States, for example, it may seem absurd to fight a war against China over uninhabited islands, even though the US government has repeatedly confirmed the US-Japan security treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands.<sup>30</sup> For China, in turn, occupying the Senkaku Islands probably appears to be less provocative and dangerous than invading densely populated Taiwan.

Finally, unlike NATO’s relatively clear-cut competitive relations with Russia, some US Alliances in East Asia are ostensibly targeted against North Korea, which is dangerous and nuclear armed but not nearly as powerful as China. In fact, the United States and its regional Allies have seen China as a potential partner to help address the challenge posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons development. If North Korea ceases to present a significant threat to Japan and to South Korea, US Alliances with these two countries will require significant political adjustments. Meanwhile, NATO is expected to play an important role in counterterrorism and geopolitics in the Middle East and North Africa. Although these new missions increase the importance of NATO, especially to the United States, they can also create friction among Allies, as was seen at the time of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.
